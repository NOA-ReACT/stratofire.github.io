Fires can be a natural and positive part of the healthy functioning of many ecosystems. However, the pattern of large or unusual fires – known as wildfires – is changing, and there is scientific consensus that climate change is promoting the conditions on which they depend, such as the frequency and intensity of fire weather.  

Fires mostly result from the interaction between climate conditions (such as temperature, moisture, and lightning), vegetation (fuel availability and dryness) and people (through land-use change, ignition, and suppression), and changes in these factors are leading to shifts in fire patterns in many regions of the world.  

It is widely known that the overall global burned area is decreasing, as explored by one report from Science magazine in 2017. This is mainly driven by land-use change from natural savannah and grasslands to agriculture. However, changes in land use can act as a driver for fires in different areas such as tropical forests, and in other regions such as high-latitude forests wildfires are increasing more in line with fire weather and fire season length. Extreme weather, a warming climate, and a build-up of dried-out vegetation acting as fuel, can also result in fires that are larger, more intense, or more frequent than normal, which can lead to the destruction of habitats (wildlife and vegetation) and negative impacts on society (destruction of infrastructure, displacement of people, and air pollution), as well as impacting carbon sinks.
