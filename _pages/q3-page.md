Smoke in the LS has effects on both the radiative balance and stratospheric chemistry. The global and regional radiative forcing of pyroCbs is still uncertain but it is expected negative for smoke at stratospheric heights by considering direct and semi-direct erffects. Contrary to this expectation, however, the only attempt to estimate the global radiative forcing of the 2017 Canadian pyroCb resulted in a value of âˆ¼0.02 W/m2 at the top of the atmosphere in the 2 months following the event. This discrepancy is likely explained by the fact that the study considered only the smoke direct radiation effect (which is positive) but neglected the semi-direct effect from changes in atmospheric stability. Other uncertainties are related to relative humidity and optical properties of smoke aerosols including internal mixing with organics or sulphates and photochemical aging processes. The high absorbing nature of smoke perturbs the local heating rates and warms the LS. The warming effect can be augmented if BC aerosols are internally mixed (e.g. lensing effect) and there is observational evidence that smoke plumes show very high fractions > 95 of internally mixed (coated) particles. **This finding of very large fractions of coated smoke particles challenges the assumption of externally mixed particles used in many previous model studies.**
