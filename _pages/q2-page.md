**Climate modelling**
**Strato**<span style="color:red">**FIRE**</span> will fuse observations with modelling to significantly reduced uncertainties related to smoke emissions. To date, only indirect methods are available to estimate smoke emission rates. Space-bone and ground-based observations provide information generally with some temporal and spatial distance from the source of the fire. In StratoFIRE we aim to apply an innovative inversion algorithm to largely improve the quantitative predictions of smoke emissions and injection heights near the tropopause.
