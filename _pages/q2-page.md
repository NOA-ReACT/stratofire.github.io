Biomass burning is considered to be the largest source of primary carbonaceous aerosol particles and a major source of trace gases into the Earth’s atmosphere . Smoke plumes are largely composed of organic carbon and black carbon, alongside numerous active gases such as H20, CO2 and SO2. Black carbon (BC) is of particular interest as it is the strongest light absorber with an efficiency sensitive to the aerosol morphology, size and mixing state. Strong absorption heats the smoke plume causing shelf-lofting to altitudes much higher than the initial injection heights directly from the pyroCb. It has been modeled that a plume made up of 2% BC and 98% organic carbon, lifted the 2017 Canadian smoke to an altitude of 23 Km, consistent with the maximum injection height detected by the spaceborne lidar CALIOP (Cloud– Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) . Hence this self-lofting mechanism significantly prolongs the lifetime of the smoke particles in the stratosphere to several months and in parallel extends the atmospheric lifetime of BC beyond the limit of a few weeks in the troposphere. Secondary aerosol formation via photochemistry of large amount of VOCs emitted by wildfires  can strongly affect stratospheric aerosol burden by pyroCbs but at present direct measurements of the amounts of resulting secondary aerosols in the stratosphere are not available. Secondary aerosol formation via photochemistry of large amount of VOCs emitted by wildfires can also strongly affect stratospheric aerosol burden by pyroCbs but at present direct measurements of the amounts of resulting secondary aerosols in the stratosphere are not available and won’t further be considered. Likewise, effects of gravito-photopheresis on smokes’ height can also be disregarded as the time scale of this process in much slower.
