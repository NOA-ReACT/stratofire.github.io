Although the stratosphere constitutes only a small fraction of the atmospheric mass, extensive research in the recent years have provided solid evidence about its key role on impacting circulation and climate on seasonal to decadal time scales. Aerosols in the stratosphere are crucial for understanding the long-term aerosol-chemistry interactions, troposphere-stratosphere coupling and the radiative forcing contributing to climate change. As key removal mechanisms of particulate matter are not effective in the stratosphere, the stratospheric smoke particles have a particularly long lifetime, allowing for long-range transport under the influence of the meridional Brewer-Dobson circulation and fast zonal wind jets. In the recent years there have been observational indications of significant trends in aerosol and water vapor in the LS. Particles in the LS may contribute to as much as ~20% of the direct total (negative) aerosol forcing, because once in the stratosphere aerosols have much stronger radiative forcing efficiency due to less attenuated solar radiation, increased radiation from the backscatter of clouds and longer residence time. The lack of a detailed characterization of the composition and variability of non-volcanic sources in the stratosphere, is one of the key uncertainties in estimating direct global radiative forcing.

Earlier research has broadly considered two major aerosol sources in the stratosphere, namely the direct injection of ash and sulphates by volcanic eruptions and the isentropic transport of carbonyl sulfide. Recent discoveries about the injection of aerosols and aerosol-precursors directly into the LS through deep pyroconvection have spotlighted a new semi-seasonal source of non-volcanic aerosols and a new forcing agent, previously not properly considered.
