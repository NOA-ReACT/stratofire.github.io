excerpt: "Fire smoke in the stratosphere: a new climate forcer"
intro: 
  - excerpt: 'Large-scale wildfires have been making global headlines over the recent years, highlighting the importance of fire and its feedback within the Earth System. The most extreme manifestation of a fire-weather interaction is the formation of pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) thunderstorms, which under particulalr conditions can inject smoke, ice and greenhouse-relevant gases deep in the stratosphere, of total burden comparable to mid-sized volcanoes.

  In this [ELIDEK project](https://www.elidek.gr/en/homepage/), we will explore whether machine-earning based emulators are capable of not only reproducing European carbon fluxes from the JULES land surface model but going beyond this and providing a means to derive a novel observation-driven dataset of GPP, built on the existing process-level understanding within the model.'

![image](assets/images/top_level.png){: style="float: right"} In order to answer the above questions, we will undertake the following activities:
* We will produce land surface model simulations from JULES over Europe for a range of terrestrial essential climate variables. 
* We will develop, train and evaluate machine learning models against the simulated land surface parameters, providing the capability to successfully emulate the complex physical process-based models.
* These emulators will be used to investigate the complex emergent relationships and feedbacks inherent in such simulations to gain an increased understanding of the underlying Earth System processes.
* We will use these emulators to test whether data from satellite-based essential climate variables (e.g. ESA-CCI) are consistent with the relationships learnt from the land surface models.
* We will produce an Emulated-GPP (gross primary productivity) data product based on EO data, using the relationships learnt from the land surface model.
