excerpt: "Fire smoke in the stratosphere: a new climate forcer"
intro: 
  - excerpt: 'The most extreme manifestation of a fire-weather interaction is the formation of **pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb)** thunderstorms, which under particulalr conditions can inject smoke, ice and greenhouse-relevant gases deep in the stratosphere, of total burden comparable to mid-sized volcanoes.


   **Strato**<span style="color:red">**FIRE**</span> will highlight the role of extreme pyroCb emissions in the stratosphere as a new short-lived climate forcer.'

**Strato**<span style="color:red">**FIRE**</span> is an [ELIDEK project](https://www.elidek.gr/en/homepage/) of the [ReACT team](https://react.space.noa.gr/) at the [National Observatory of Athens](https://www.noa.gr/). In next three years **(2022-2025)** the project will: 

* provide all necessary breakthroughs regarding our understanding of properties, lifetime and impact of smoke particles 
* develop sophisticated inversion techniques initialized by observations to calculate emissions in the stratosphere
* calculate the global and regional radiative forcing of pyroCbs 
* simulate heterogenous chemistry in the smoke plume with a global climate model

**Strato**<span style="color:red">**FIRE**</span> will connect extreme wildfires, smoke and global climate.
